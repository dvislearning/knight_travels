# knight_travels

knight_travels uses breadth first search to find the shortest path a knight would have to travel on a chess board given a start point and an end point.

A new Knight object has to be initialized with a starting_square array along with an ending_square array
Afterwards, #knight_moves is run to see the path it has to take.
